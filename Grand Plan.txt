A.3.2.1 - WorldMap Pixels
8:40 PM - Dehaku: ...
8:40 PM - Dehaku: Just...
8:40 PM - Dehaku: Had a thought.
8:41 PM - Dehaku: Fuck, Lost it.
8:41 PM - Dehaku: Oh! right! Pixel maps!
8:41 PM - Everything: Pixel maps?
8:41 PM - Dehaku: If I change the tiles size to 32x32...
8:41 PM - Dehaku: I can have a chunk's tiles BE the worldmap's tile.
8:41 PM - Dehaku: Like for each dirt tile in local, there'd be one brown pixel on the worldmap tile.
8:42 PM - Dehaku: I had that idea because the buildings will not actually look like their images.
8:42 PM - Everything: So a map would be thirty-two times larger than the real world.
8:42 PM - Everything: Or thirty-two times smaller?
8:42 PM - Everything: Blagh.
8:42 PM - Dehaku: You've got the right idea, and I don't know.
8:42 PM - Dehaku: It'd be like zooming out 32x
8:42 PM - Everything: Yeah.
8:42 PM - Dehaku: Not only would the map tiles look exactly like what the chunk is ACTUALLY made of...
8:43 PM - Dehaku: But the players could actually see the devestation and what not they cause on in a region.
8:43 PM - Dehaku: Imagine if you nuked a city.
8:43 PM - Everything: You mean the crater?
8:43 PM - Dehaku: With the current method, You wouldn't see anything.
8:43 PM - Everything: I don't see a city.
8:43 PM - Dehaku: With the pixel map method...
8:43 PM - Dehaku: You'd see a gaint fucking crator.
8:43 PM - Dehaku: And you could even see the rubble of buildings.
8:44 PM - Dehaku: Whoooa...
8:44 PM - Dehaku: I could go one deeper...
8:44 PM - Dehaku: There's methods for messing with pixels using SFML.
8:44 PM - Dehaku: I could actually like...
8:44 PM - Dehaku: Do tile logic... from... Outside chunks.
8:44 PM - Dehaku: Hard to describe.
8:45 PM - Dehaku: A... chunk... would be built... using the info from the worldmap's tile image...
8:45 PM - Dehaku: And using Pixel map's logic I could effect massive areas without having to deal with chunks.
8:46 PM - Dehaku: For example, Back to the nuke...
8:46 PM - Dehaku: To actually nuke tiles, You'd have to load the chunk, Then do alot of replacing, Then load the next one.
8:46 PM - Dehaku: Which would be a pain in the arse to do a circular thing, with that method.
8:46 PM - Dehaku: But with pixel maps, I'd replace all the pixels in a circle on the world map.
8:46 PM - Dehaku: And that would effect the actual tiles in the chunks.
8:47 PM - Dehaku: I can see only two problems with this.
8:47 PM - Dehaku: First, It may occasionally be a pain to do things like that, Since a pixel wouldn't store all the data of a class, But I could just check if it 'needs' info from that tile, then load up that chunk, get that tiles data using the pixel position.
8:48 PM - Dehaku: So, a little bit annoying, But easier to do macro changes.
8:48 PM - Dehaku: Second...
8:48 PM - Dehaku: There's a limited amount of tiles then, Due to pixel maps being done by color.
8:48 PM - Dehaku: There cannot be two 'different' red tiles.
8:48 PM - Dehaku: Buuut...What kinda... Stuff?
8:49 PM - Dehaku: (255x255)x255, I may be doing that wrong, Don't care.
8:49 PM - Dehaku: That'd be how many tiles possible, Haha.
8:49 PM - Dehaku: 16581375 possible tiles.
8:49 PM - Dehaku: (Calculator, I'm not that good, Heh)
8:50 PM - Dehaku: What do you think?
8:50 PM - Everything: That's a rediculous amount.
8:50 PM - Dehaku: -doesn't want to bug, but excited about new method-
8:50 PM - Everything: About all I CAN say.
8:50 PM - Dehaku: A slight problem though, Is that if you want it to be a certain color...
8:50 PM - Dehaku: You'd have to be careful with the range of color.
8:51 PM - Dehaku: But, I highly doubt I'll have 200 different types of walls.
8:51 PM - Dehaku: So walls can be 100,100,100
8:51 PM - Dehaku: I gotta save this chatlog, I don't want to loose this idea.

9:00 PM - Dehaku: One small... annoyance with the pixel maps though.
9:00 PM - Dehaku: For every single- Nevermind, I just solved it in my head.
9:01 PM - Dehaku: I was going to say, It's going to be annoying creating a list in code for each ID to have it's own color in the pixel map.
9:01 PM - Dehaku: Buuuut...
9:01 PM - Dehaku: Then I remember'd, I'm using Classes for my tiles.
9:01 PM - Dehaku: So I can just add a "WorldMapColor" variable to the tile classes.
9:01 PM - Dehaku: So, That complicated issue just became an easy one.
