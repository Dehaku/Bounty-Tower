1/12/2014 and below.
Haven't updated in awhile the log in awhile, Lots of new goodies.
Actually fixed the path finding problem this time around.
The transitional map now reads from the world map, so you can now head off to interesting building formations or some such.
Critters and items are now saved and loaded during map movement.
Got a small graphics "Spit shine" from Enemby.


11/15/2013
Took alot of messing around, But we now have a fast, clean, and accurate transitional map movement through the chunks.

11/12/2013
Finished up the Squad Creation Menu, You can now create new Squaddies, and distribute the stats accordingly.
Added a button to allow you to choose where to land you squad.

Too much has gone by for me to recall it all.

:::0.0.0.5:::
::Added
Added Skills.Train(), Skills now gain XP when they are used.
Fixed some odd movement problems, And slowed down the speed of movement.
Implemented a item system, which reads through all the entries in items.txt, creates an item class with the information, and puts it into
 a new global item class, This allows automation of all item management by the system, Not to mention Moddability.
Also did the same with the images, But not as spectacular.
Debug Item Spawn Menu(Hold Tab, Click Button, Receive Modded Bacon).
Critters now go and eat/drink if they are hungry/thirsty, even if they have a weapon and enemies nearby.
Changed how critters are able to move, It now has a much more precise speed increment.(Although this made the path finding lines a bit wonky)

::Fixes
The vision process for critters used to be a cos sin rotation infront of them, 180 degrees, and every iteration of that function, would have
 a trace that ran from the critter, to that radius. 
 180 degrees, at a 200 distance, with the occasional overlapping of pixels, multiplied by NPC count. It became expensive quick.
 But now it checks the distance between the two, then checks to the angle from the target, to the critter, if the angle is within the current
 view angle of the critter, it can be seen. So only about 5 checks, multiplied by NPC count.
Critters no longer go faster while Path Finding.
Critters will not shoot at stuff unless they are close enough.
Fixed the Turret, It will now protect the base, Be warned It's not as intelligent as normal critters.
Fixed the zoom feature(-,+)

:::0.0.0.4:::
::Added
Waves of zombies come, Increasing amount as time goes on.
Humans will fire at zombies now, If they have a gun in their possession.
Humans will swing at zombies if they have a sword.
Humans will shoot far, swing close, if they have both weapons.
Sword damage: 10+Strength.
Gun damage: 100+perception.
Gun Accuracy improved by Dexterity.
Agility effects attack speed.
Critter's stats show on the HUD.
::Fixes
Entity.HasWeapon("") now properly checks if you have the specified weapon.
Fixed random crash on Local Test Setup, It was some misplaced randomization logic.
::Removed

:::0.0.0.3:::
::Added
Crude Tile class, Works great for drawing, Not sure about the eventual world building algorithums.
Decent Button Method, Highly useful.
Creatures can now naturally path around for their targets.
Created an Inventory Check for weapons in the creatures.
Added a better management system for finding Vector Id's.
Creatures will now keep eating/drinking until they are full.
You can now press c with a critter selected to set the camera to follow them.

::Fixes
Fixed a speed bug that doubled a creatures speed while they were path finding.
"Fixed" the distance check a bit more, Still not perfect, but alot more accurate now.
Set only tiles within the view to be drawn, tripled the FPS.
Finally fixed the cursed distance function, It properly reads the correct distance on a perfect orbit.
Took a long time, There is now a proper gravity method.


::Removed
Removed the auto smoothener for graphics, Things are much more crisp now.

::Bugs
Localtest randomly freezes on startup.
Critters still go faster while path finding than their normal speed.

::To-Do
Add a knowledge database into each creature, to see if they know where something is or not.
Create an automatic Image Manager that will load up all images in the gfx folder, for easier management.
Create a random function for a circle circlerand(min,max,radius)
Rearrange the brain of the creatures to directly link their target to the searches, instead of a search per item, Probably
 use a string to seperate Item and NPC.
Add the ability to follow multiple critters with your camera at once, Most likely average the total positions and set the camera there.
