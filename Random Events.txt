An ungodly being guised as a simple humanoid wanders the world. Upon being encountered, He will seem hostile, but never deal any attacks, He is perfectly skilled, and cannot be harmed.
If all units around him unequip all their weapons for a few seconds, he will become curious. After a bit longer, he'll say something, then offer his blessing.
