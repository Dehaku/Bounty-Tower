This is the list for aspects to use in Status Effect definition, statusEffects.txt

'Type' can be any string of characters appropriote to the aspect type. (And sometimes numbers, If specified)

Example Usage: [Aspect:AffectHealth:-1:Fire], AffectHealth is the AspectName, -1 is the potency, dealing 1 damage per frame, Fire is the type, The type of damage dealt.

Damage Types: None,Blunt,Pierce,Slash,Fire,Cold,Poison,Electric,Acid,Energy


Aspects - The meat and potatos of status effects, mmm, I'm hungry now.

[Aspect:AffectHealth:Amount:DamageType]
AffectHealth directly modifies the health of the carrier by the Amount every frame, This can be used for healing if positive, or harming if negitive.

[Aspect:AffectDamage:Amount:DamageType]
AffectDamage applies to the damage the carrier does of DamageType, acting as a multiplier. 25 Amount, adds 25% more damage. (Negitives reduce damage dealt), Warning, Multiple instances of this aspect has a compounding effect, not a stacking one.

[Aspect:Armor:Amount:DamageType]
Armor modifies the damage the carrier takes of DamageType, acting as a multiplier. 25 amount, reduces damage by 25%. (Negitives enhance damage taken.), Warning, Multiple instances of this aspect has a compounding effect, not a stacking one.

[Aspect:Attribute:Amount:AttributeName]
Attribute grants a direct effect to the specified attribute(With AttributeName), Negitive numbers will reduce the attribute.

[Aspect:MoveSpeed:Amount]
MoveSpeed directly applies it's Amount to movement, if you must, do this in small amounts, speed can be a hell of a drug.

[Aspect:Freeze:Amount]
Freeze completely disables the creature from all actions, Amount is essentially the health of this aspect. Taking damage directly lowers this potency(to 0.), If potency is at 0 or less, It no longer has any effect. (ALL instances of this aspect take the same damage from a hit, multiple instances do not provide additional freeze health)
Due to how this aspect works, an Aura projecting a Freeze aspect will likely be unbreakable by damage. This can be unbalancing.

[Aspect:Sleep:Amount]
Sleep completely disables the creature from all actions, Amount needs to be at least 1, If the carrier takes any damage, they're awoken instantly.
Due to how this aspect works, an Aura projecting a Sleep aspect will likely be unwakable. This can be unbalancing.

[Aspect:Stun:Amount]
Sleep disables the use of items, Amount needs to be at least 1.

[Aspect:Thorns:Amount:DamageType]
Thorns causes anyone who attacks the carrier(*With A Melee Weapon*) to take a flat Amount of damage of DamageType, This is not enhanced by the carrier by any means, though the carrier is credited for damage dealt to others. (Allowing XP to be claimed). I don't recommend adding a OnHitByType conditional to this, since it's already restricted to melee attacks. Doubt it'll work, but do as you want.

[Aspect:Immunity:Amount:DamageType]
Immunity causes the carrier to take no effects from an attack of DamageType.

[Aspect:XPModifier:Amount]
XPModifier modifies the amount of XP the carrier receives from all sources, by 'amount' percent.

[Aspect:DeathXPModifier:Amount]
DeathXPModifier modifies the amount of XP the carrier gives out to their killer, by 'amount' percent.

[Aspect:ItemFind:Amount]
ItemFind increases the rolled item chance by 'Amount', Raising odds of getting items.

[Aspect:ItemDropRate:Amount]
ItemDropRate increases the odds of dropping items by 'Amount' percent.

[Aspect:SpawnCreature:1:Race]
SpawnCreature simply spawns a wild version of whatever Race is specified(As listed in npcs.txt), Wild means they will be hostile to 'everyone'. Be warned this will trigger every frame, this is best on 1 duration status effects, or rare conditions. (Like OnDeath)

[Aspect:SpawnItem:Amount:Item]
SpawnItem simply spawns the specified item(As listed in items.txt) with an amount equal to 'Amount'(This will not overrule stackSizes)  Be warned this will trigger every frame, this is best on 1 duration status effects, or rare conditions. (Like OnDeath)
WARNING: The specified Item cannot have any colons in it's name. " : ", This will cause a crash if attempted to spawn.

[Aspect:Revive:Amount]
Revive instantly brings the carrier back to life at max health, 'Amount' can act as a lives counter, Example... [Aspect:Revive:9] will cause the carrier to revive nine times. (Assuming the status effect this aspect belongs to lasts that long.)
WARNING: DO NOT PUT THIS ON AN ITEM(Unless with some heavy conditions), It literally makes it impossible to die, Hah. Gamebreaking, yo.




Conditional Aspects - These don't do anything for the carrier, they simply restrict the status effect for more variety and interesting flavors, Like adding gravy to your potatos, or chili... now I'm drooling.
Please keep in mind that status effects are read left to right, and as soon as a condition is not met, all further aspects are ignored.
Example: [Name:Test][Duration:600][AffectHealth:1:Energy][Aspect:ConditionOnHit:1][Aspect:AffectHealth:500:Energy]
The carrier will always be healed for 1 health per frame, but the massive 500 only occurs on the frame that they are hit.
Multiple conditions can be used, and at any point in the status effect.

[Aspect:ConditionHealth:Percentage:Above/Below]
ConditionHealth requires the carriers health to either be above, or below the defined percentage, of their max health, [Aspect:ConditionHealth:50:Below] means all further aspects will only trigger if the carrier is below half health.

[Aspect:ConditionLife:Unused:Dead/Alive]
ConditionLife requires the carrier to be in the specified state of either Dead or Alive, Example: [Name:Pointless Healing][Duration:3600][Aspect:ConditionLife:1:Dead][Aspect:AffectHealth:3:Energy] This will heal the carrier for 3 health per frame while they are dead. (This will not revive the carrier.)

[Aspect:ConditionOnItemUse:1:ItemTypeNumber]
This condition allows further aspects to work on the frame the specified item type is used. (Sorry folks, ItemType is a number, 1 = Melee Weapons, 2 = Ranged Weapons, 23 = PDA, 42 = Potions, 69 = Inventory Slot Upgrade), Example: [Name:Heal On Melee][Duration:600][Aspect:ConditionOnItemUse:1:1][Aspect:AffectHealth:250:Energy]
You can also simply leave out the last part to have it trigger on ANY item use. Example: [Aspect:ConditionOnItemUse:1]

[Aspect:ConditionOnDeath:1]
ConditionOnDeath allows further aspects to trigger on the frame of the carriers death. (Good for explosions, revivals or other silly tidbits.)

[Aspect:ConditionOnHit:1]
ConditionOnHit allows further aspects to trigger on the frame of being hit from any damage source.

[Aspect:ConditionOnHitByType:1:DamageType]
ConditionOnHitByTime is similar to ConditionOnHit, Except it only allows further aspects to trigger if the hit was of DamageType. (Do not put two of these in the same status effect, unless they are of the same damage type, even then, that's redundent. Two different ones cannot work together.)

[Aspect:ConditionTimeDelay:Amount]
ConditionTimeDelay simply reduces it's amount by 1 per frame, Once it's at 0 or below, It allows further aspects to trigger. Please be sure the initial 'Amount' is more than the Status Effect's duration, Otherwise it'll never trigger. Oh, and don't use this on an Aura status effect.
