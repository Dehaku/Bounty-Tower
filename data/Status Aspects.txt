Aspects
[Aspect:AffectHealth:Amount:DamageType]
AffectHealth directly modifies the health of the carrier by the Amount every frame, This can be used for healing if positive, or harming if negitive.

[Aspect:AffectDamage:Amount:DamageType]
AffectDamage applies to the damage the carrier does of DamageType, acting as a multiplier. 25 Amount, adds 25% more damage. (Negitives reduce damage dealt), Warning, Multiple instances of this aspect has a compounding effect, not a stacking one.

[Aspect:Armor:Amount:DamageType]
Armor modifies the damage the carrier takes of DamageType, acting as a multiplier. 25 amount, reduces damage by 25%. (Negitives enhance damage taken.), Warning, Multiple instances of this aspect has a compounding effect, not a stacking one.

[Aspect:Attribute:Amount:AttributeName]
Attribute grants a direct effect to the specified attribute(With AttributeName), Negitive numbers will reduce the attribute.

[Aspect:MoveSpeed:Amount]
MoveSpeed directly applies it's Amount to movement, if you must, do this in small amounts, speed can be a hell of a drug.

[Aspect:Freeze:Amount]
Freeze completely disables the creature from all actions, Amount is essentially the health of this aspect. Taking damage directly lowers this potency(to 0.), If potency is at 0 or less, It no longer has any effect. (ALL instances of this aspect take the same damage from a hit, multiple instances do not provide additional freeze health)
Due to how this aspect works, an Aura projecting a Freeze aspect will likely be unbreakable by damage. This can be unbalancing.

[Aspect:Sleep:Amount]
Sleep completely disables the creature from all actions, Amount needs to be at least 1, If the carrier takes any damage, they're awoken instantly.
Due to how this aspect works, an Aura projecting a Sleep aspect will likely be unwakable. This can be unbalancing.

[Aspect:Stun:Amount]
Sleep disables the use of items, Amount needs to be at least 1.

[Aspect:Thorns:Amount:DamageType]
Thorns causes anyone who attacks the carrier(*With A Melee Weapon*) to take a flat Amount of damage of DamageType, This is not enhanced by the carrier by any means, though the carrier is credited for damage dealt to others. (Allowing XP to be claimed)
